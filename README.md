This provided an in-depth understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) utilizing the OpenCV library and the YOLO framework, along with the COCO names dataset. By leveraging Python libraries, we effectively detected vehicles, specifically cars, to analyze their performance and road presence. The primary objective was to identify cars and their logos in video feeds or live environments, enabling performance prediction that can be advantageous for automotive brands.
